# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was implemented for the date and time. Some base html and css was provided and modified as needed.
